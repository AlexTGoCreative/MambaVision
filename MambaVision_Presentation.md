## Slide 2: The Problem with Current Vision Architectures

**Title:** Challenges in Modern Computer Vision

**Content:**

### Traditional Approaches Have Limitations:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - ✅ Excellent at local feature extraction

   - ❌ Hierarchical but not globally aware

2. **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**
   - ✅ Global attention and long-range modeling
   - ❌ Quadratic complexity O(n²) with sequence length
   - ❌ Computationally expensive for high-resolution images

## Slide 3: What is Mamba?

**Title:** State Space Models Meet Deep Learning

**Content:**

### Mamba: Revolutionary Sequence Modeling

**State Space Models (SSMs) Foundation:**
```
h(t) = Ah(t-1) + Bx(t)    # State evolution
y(t) = Ch(t) + Dx(t)      # Output generation
```

**Key Innovation: Selective State Spaces**
- **Dynamic Parameters**: A, B, C matrices depend on input
- **Linear Complexity**: O(n) instead of O(n²) for attention
- **Selective Memory**: Forget irrelevant, remember important information

### Why Mamba Works:
1. **Efficiency**: Linear scaling with sequence length
2. **Selectivity**: Input-dependent parameter selection
3. **Hardware Friendly**: Efficient parallelization
4. **Long Sequences**: Handles very long contexts effectively

**Visual Analogy:** Like a smart camera that adjusts focus based on what's important in the scene

## Slide 5: MambaVision Architecture Deep Dive

**Title:** Detailed Architecture Components

**Content:**

### 1. Patch Embedding Layer
```
Input Image (224×224×3) → Patches (16×16) → Tokens (196×embed_dim)
```

### 2. Mamba Block Structure
```python
# Simplified Mamba Block
class MambaBlock:
    def forward(x):
        # 1. Input projection and gating
        x_gated, residual = split(linear_proj(x))
        
        # 2. Local convolution
        x_conv = conv1d(x_gated)
        
        # 3. State space modeling
        dt = softplus(dt_proj(x_conv))
        x_ssm = x_conv * dt  # Simplified selective scan
        
        # 4. Gating and output
        return output_proj(x_ssm * activation(residual)) + x
```

### 3. Transformer Block Structure
```python
# Standard Transformer Block
class TransformerBlock:
    def forward(x):
        # Self-attention with residual
        x = x + multi_head_attention(layer_norm(x))
        
        # MLP with residual
        x = x + mlp(layer_norm(x))
        return x
```

### 4. Hybrid Block Arrangement
